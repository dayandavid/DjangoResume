# A Resume web app using Django and PostgreSQL

I used this project to practice some django and frontend animations using gsap.
All the javascript used are local and are in the project. I made this project offline so 
i had to download all the used libs.

In order to introduce your data in the app you must access the admin in the /admin/ url. For that
you will need superuser created with:

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

## Requirements

- Python: 3.8.5

- Django: 3.0.1

- PostgreSQL: 9.5
